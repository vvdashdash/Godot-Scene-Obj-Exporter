# GodotObjExporter

Super rudimentary stupid obj exporter

This exports every mesh that is the child of the node the script is attached to, so you can export full scenes, but they will all be one conjoined object with no material groups or smoothing groups or anything

Just attach the script to a node in editor, set the paths and name, and press the activate button
