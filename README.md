# GodotObjExporter

Super rudimentary stupid obj exporter, personally made so I can bring scenes into other software for animation. Doesnt export meshes as separate objects nor does it export smoothing groups, material groups or literally any other property you can think of beyond verts and faces

This exports every mesh that is the child of the node the script is attached to, so you can export full scenes

Just attach the script to a node in editor, set the path and name, and press the activate button
